# HDL-and-Assembly-Projects
My Solutions for the assignments of part 1 of Nand2Tetris offered by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. This course guides students through the design of HDL programs that specify a general purpose computer. Uploaded here to showcase my skills and help current students. Some skeleton code was provided by course instructors. If you are a student please use these as inspiration but do not just copy and paste to ace assignments. It is a violation of Academic integrity and will hinder any real learning.

## 01: Logic Gates
HDL implementations of a variety of logic gates from project 1.
## 02: ALU
HDL implementations of arithmetic chips and ALU.
## 03: Memory
Program counter chip and RAM.
## 04: Assembly Programming
A multiplcation operation and a screen manipulation exercise implemented in assembly language.
## 05: CPU and Hardware Platform
Combining the chips designed in previous projects to complete the CPU and full computer.
## 06: Assembler
An assembler for the computer designed in Python.
